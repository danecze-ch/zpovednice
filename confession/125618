British Isles consists of two parts: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland. It covers an area of about 244 thousand square kilometres.
Besides the largest islands Great Britain (divided into England, Scotland and
Wales) and Ireland we should mention the Isle of Wight, the Isles of Scilly,
and the Isle of Man, Angleseys, the Hebrides, the Orkneys and the Shatlands.
England is mostly rolling land, rising to the Uplands of the southern
Scotland. The main mountain regions here are the Cornish Heights in the south-
west England, the Cambrians in Wales, the Cumbrian Mountains in the Lake
District, the Pennines which is called the Backbone of England and the
mountains of Snowdonia National park. The highest mountain are Ben Nevis in
the Highlands of Scotland (1342m) and Snowdon in North Wales (1085m). The
longest rivers are the Severn and the Thames in England, while Scotland's
chief river is the Clyde. The best known lakes are those in the Lake District
and those in Scotland (Loch Lomond and Loch Ness). Population is about
57,000,000 people. In Britain, we can find the following ethnic groups:
English, Scottish, Irish, Welsh. The majority of people speak English.
Great Britain is a constitutional monarchy. The head of state is queen
Elizabeth II. The main body is Parliament. Houses of Parliament consist of the
House of Commons and the House of Lords and they are in gothic style. British
parliamentary system is one of the oldest in the world (13th century) The
Government is formed by the party which has the majority in Parliament and the
queen appoints its leader as the prime minister. The Prime Minister appoints a
team of main ministers as the Cabinet. There are two main political parties:
the Labour Party (left) and the Conservative Party (right). Scotland is a
historically and culturally separate country from England. It has its own
legal and educational system and currency. The biggest city is Glasgow and the
capitol is Edinburgh. Scotland is land of many special traditions which can’t
be found in elsewhere in the world – playing pipes, woolen knitwear or Scotch
Whisky. Wales is sometimes called the land of castles. Among the best known
are Caernarfon, where Prince Charles was invested as Prince of Wales, Conwy
and Harlech. The land is ful of mystery and beauty. The big cities are there
Cardiff, Newport and Swansea.
The capital of the whole Britain is London which is world famous as a musical
centre. It is the 9th largest city in the world and it’s situated on the river
Thames. London is rich in museums and galleries whose exhibitions are usually
free of charge. The most famouse is Madame Tussand's, it contains wax
portraits of famous and infamous world figures but it isn’t free of charge. I
was there and it was wonderful. There is for example Martina Navrátilová and
Václav Havel too. We can see there lots of places of interest. For example:
Westminster Abbey, Whitehall, Backingham Palace or St. Pauls Cathedral which
is one of the largest cathedral in the world. The most famous symbol of London
is Tower Bridge. It can open in the middle and let large ships go through.
In my opinion, Britain is very beautyful country. I was there in many towns in
England and in Scotland too. The best known towns are: Oxford is the seat of
the oldest English university which includes 34 colleges now. Cambridge which
is the residence of the second oldest university in Britain. Stratford-upon-
Avon is the birthplace of William Shakespear. In Manchester we can visit The
Museum of science, industry and space museum. There is also the most famous
english football team – Manchester United. The other big cities here are
Liverpool, Leeds and Shefield. National park which is worth to see is The lake
District.
Some Typical
The British are very polite and have good manners – they are never tired of
saying „Thank you“ , „I’m sorry“ or „Execuse me“. They don’t shake hands as
people on continent. They like spending their leisure time at home with the
family and pets. They enjoy breakfast and most of all the traditional tea
around 4 or 5 o’clock. The british invited codified the rules of many sports
and games which are now played all over the world – football, rugby, cricket
or golf.

Main town is London. It is the 9th largest city in the world - it´s population
is about 10 million. London is situated on the river Thames in south-east
England. The Romans came to London in 43 A. D. They built a small town on the
Thames, its name was Londinium. In 1066 William the Conqueror came to England.
He came from Normandy after the battle of Hastings. He became the King of
England. On Sunday 2nd September 1666, there was a great fire, which destroyed
almost all the city.There are many places of interest. We can see them by
walking or going by various means of transport. London´s famous red double-
deckers go almost everywhere. To be faster, we can use the underground. It´s
the oldest underground in the world. There are also 3 airports in London (the
most important are Heathrow and Gatwick).How I have said, in London we can
find a lot of places of interest. We can start our sightseeing tour in centre
on Piccadilly Circus.When we walk from Piccadilly Circus threw Regent street
and Oxford Street which are the most famous shopping centres, we come to Hyde
park, which is the largest green park in London..From Hyde park, we can go to
Buckingham Palace. It is the Queen’s residence in London. Here is one of the
biggest London’s parades - Changing the Guard.Near the Buckingham Palace there
is the Victoria Station. Victoria station is railway station, where the trains
from France threw the Channel tunnel come. When we go threw Victoria street,
we come to Westminster Abbey. It was founded in the 11th century. Britain´s
Kings and Queens have been crowned here and many of them are buried here.. It
is an excellent example of gothic architecture. Then we can visit The Houses
of Parliament. They are in gothic style but they were built only in 1840 after
the old building had burnt down. The only part which escaped the fire was
Westminster Hall. There is also a famous clock-tower with Big Ben and its
characteristic bell-ringing. The best photo you can take from the Westminster
Bridge.Then we can go along Whitehall, in which takes place Horse Guards
Parade, come we to the Downing Street 10, which is the official home of
British Prime Ministers since 1731. At the end of Whitehall is Trafalgar
Square. It was named after Admiral Nelson’s victory over Napoleon. Here is a
Nelson’s statue. This place is very popular place for demonstrations and
meetings. At Christmas time a big Christmas tree stands here.One part of
London is called The City. It is the oldest part of London around St. Paul´s.
There are many banks e. g. the Bank of England. St. Paul´s Cathedral is one of
the largest cathedrals in the world. This great renaissance dome is the work
of the famous architect Sir Christopher Wren and it was built in the 17th
century after the great fire. The Cathedral is known for its Whispering
Gallery.The next interesting place is The Tower of London. It was built in the
11th century. It served as royal palace first, then prison and fortress. It is
a museum now. The Crown Jewels are kept here.Tower Bridge is one of the most
famous symbols of London. It was built only in the last century. It can open
in the middle and let large ships go through.The British Museum is the largest
museum in the world. There is a collection of Egyptian mummies and antiquities
from ancient Greece. The admission is free.The Post Office Tower is the
tallest building in Great Britain. It is 190 m high.With 40 theatres and music
halls London is the centre of cultural life. The most important are: The
National Theatre, The Royal Festival hall and The Royal Albert Hall.In Kew
Gardens we can find the largest collection of living plants in the
world.Greenwich is the seat of the National Maritime Museum.
