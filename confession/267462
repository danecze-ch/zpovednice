 Why the Czech Republic is the best count
 I am going to express my opinion why the Czech Republic is the best country
 in the world. This statement might be a little bit provoking, but in this
 essay I am going to prove that.
 First of all I would like to show you the geographical advantages, which the
 Czech Republic surely has. For first, what is necessary to mention, is that
 the Czech Republic is not on any coast of the oceans and the seas. I might
 look like a disadvantage because of the tourism, but in fact it is a huge
 advantage and I will tell you why. First of all, there is lesser number of
 tourists comparing to the other countries, which makes the Czech Republic
 more comfortable. Second of all we all know about the Global Warming and
 about the fact that the level of oceans would rise for about 1-2 meters, so
 due to a common fact, that the Czech Republic is not on the coast, we can
 say that it’s safe. One of the other advantages is the position in Europe.
 This country is located in the heart of Europe, but still more on the west,
 which gives to this beautiful country higher prestige in the world.
 My next argument for this statement is the most beautiful nature in the
 world, which is in the Czech Republic. Around the borders there are mostly
 mountains and the highest peak is on the north of the CR and it is called
 the Mountain of Snow. These mountains were created in the Paleozoic and
 therefore they are very old and nice. The result is that due to the old age
 of them they are not sharp, but they are rounded and green, there are fields
 and forests on them. If you visit these mountains, in the nice green forest,
 where the birds are singing and everything smells so sweet, you think you
 are in the paradise. It is true that in this country you can’t find very
 high mountains; there are only two of them which consist of stone and which
 are cold – and I suppose that this is not very nice. Also there are many
 rivers and streams in this country and all of them are simply beautiful. You
 could see some fast streams in the mountains hidden in the forests, so wild
 and fast like a cheetah. Lately these streams are changing themselves into a
 majestic river, which runs through the cities and through the countryside.
 I’ve already mentioned the cities, so I have to write few words about the
 greatest and the nicest city, which is of course the capital of the Czech
 Republic, Prague. This city is both historical and modern. Prague is divided
 within two sides by the Vltava River. There is a historical centre with
 narrow streets and some very old houses. On the top of the small hill upon
 the Vltava River, there is settled the Prague Castle, which makes the
 Prague’s panorama very nice. But I have to mention some of the other cities
 like Olomouc, also a very historical city which is the capital of the
 eastern part of the country, called Moravia. There of course are hundreds of
 other nice cities, but it is impossible to mention all of them.
 One of the other aspects is the economical factor. It means that for those
 people living there is easy to live because of low prices and high income,
 if you are graduated. The Czech Republic is one of the cheapest countries in
 the Europe, it is true, that it is not the cheapest one, but on the other
 side this country has a high standard of living. Also the politic situation
 is very favorable for the businessmen and for the normal citizens, which
 makes this country to be a paradise.


 What is a country without its people? Probably nothing and this is a next
 reason why is the Czech Republic the best country in the world, because of
 the people, which are living there. When you are in this country, for
 example in Prague and you meet some people you can see how good they are.
 You could speak to the people on the street and if you are in the trouble,
 there is always someone who wants to help you to keep you out of your
 trouble. But still I haven’t mentioned the most important part of this
 population – the girls, obviously. If you wonder where the nicest girls are,
 you should visit this country, because nowhere else you can meet girls like
 there. You can find something beautiful on each of them, they are nice and
 sweet in a word and they are simply beautiful.
 In the conclusion I would like to say just that: this country is a paradise,
 where it is good to live, but not many people could really live there. In
 all aspects is this country the nicest country in the world. And if you
 don’t believe me, there is just one more thing I’d like to say to you: you
 should visit the Czech Republic and enjoy your being there!

To tam na tý škole píšete dobrý kraviny. Ne že by tvůj esej byl přímo kravina,
ale hloubku to žádnou nemá, vtip moc taky ne. Tím tě nechci nějak urazit, co
taky vyždímat ze zadání, když máš napsat esej, ve kterém argumentuješ. K
argumentaci jsou potřeba dva, pak to k něčemu vypadá. Jestli vás nutí psát
takoéhle blbosti, je to podle mě vyhozený čas.

Být učitelem, tak radši třeba zadám nějaké téma a vybídnu studenty, ať k němu
zaujmou nějaký postoj a ať si připraví argumenty pro jeho obhajobu ve společné
diskuzi. Napsat takovýhle esej, kde chybí protiargumenty, je o ničem. Leda by
se to pojalo humorně.

A nice leaflet for a travel agency :-)
About the goodness and hospitality of people you meet in the streets - who are
you comparing them to? Because I've heard of exact opposite.
