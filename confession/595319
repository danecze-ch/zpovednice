Návod na potraty (anglicky)
Tento návod zveřejnila jedna z bývalých Jane's v rámci současné snahy o zákaz
interrupcí v USA - aby poukázala na to, že zákaz interrupce pouze zakáže, avšak
nezastaví, takže pokud je někdo motivován ochranou plodečků a embryjek, tak se
na to může rovnou vyfláknout, protože zákaz nebude fungovat.
Nelegální interrupce je super kšeft, jak už máte nakoupené nástroje, tak jsou
náklady minimální, zisky vysoké a neplatí se z toho daně. Z mnohaleté praxe v
mnoha zemích je známo, že tresty za nelegální interrupce padají jen zřídka,
takže je to i relativně bezpečná činnost. Samozřejmě ne zcela bez rizika, ale
pokud nemusíte mít výdělek 100% legální, tak poměr zisku a rizika je zde velmi
příznivý.

Co myslíte? Myslíte si, že většina protipotratářů žije v omylu, který tento
článek zmiňuje hned na začátku - umělý potrat je něco velmi složitého, může ho
provést jenom lékař a jenom v nemocnici, amatér nemá šanci to zvládnout a bez
speciálního vybavení se neobejde... anebo že vědí, že potraty nezastaví, ale
jsou motivovaní nenávistí k ženám a doufají, že snad alespoň budou mít
nelegální potraty větší úmrtnost a větší počet zdravotních komplikací, tudíž že
čubky dostanou co proto, hahaha.

Návod můžete posoudit zde. Skutečnost, že nežijeme v roce 1960, a že už
existuje mifepriston, který se v řadě zemí prodává jako lék na žaludeční vředy
a jistě se dá lukrativně dovážet do zemí stižených interrupčním zákazem, o tom
ani nemluvím, to je ještě bezpečnější a jednodušší; vlastně Women on Waves ho
dokonce rozesílají poštou s návodem k použití a nazdat. Převeďte na účet 70
euro, obratem pošťák přinese potrat rovnou do domu, ani nemusíte do nemocnice.

For the women of South Dakota: an abortion manual
I understand that you're probably really angry right now. Maybe you're reading
a blog expressing that anger -- the anger that your state thinks it knows
better than you what to do with your body. Maybe you're anxiously wondering
where the nearest abortion clinic is, now that you will have to leave the state
to get to one. If you have a serious medical condition, you might be doubling
up on birth control methods, leading to a lot of worry and possibly negative
side effects.

But what you need right now isn't the righteous anger the rest of the
blogosphere will give you. You need more.

In the 1960s and early 1970s, when abortions were illegal in many places and
expensive to get, an organization called Jane stepped up to the plate in the
Chicago area. Jane initially hired an abortion doctor, but later they did the
abortions themselves. They lost only one patient in 13,000 -- a lower death
rate than that of giving live birth. The biggest obstacle they had, though, was
the fact that until years into the operation, they thought of abortion as
something only a doctor could do, something only the most trained specialist
could perform without endangering the life of the woman.

They were deceived -- much like you have probably been deceived. An abortion,
especially for an early pregnancy, is a relatively easy procedure to perform.
And while I know, women of South Dakota, that you never asked for this, now is
the time to learn how it is done. There is no reason you should be beholden to
doctors -- especially in a state where doctors have been refusing to perform
them, forcing the state's only abortion clinic to fly doctors in from
elsewhere.

No textbooks or guides existed at that time to help them, and the equipment was
hard to find. This is no longer true. For under $2000, any person with the
inclination to learn could create a fully functioning abortion setup allowing
for both vacuum aspiration and dilation/curettage abortions. If you are careful
and diligent, and have a good grasp of a woman's anatomy you will not put
anyone's health or life in danger, even if you have not seen one of these
procedures performed.

Today, I will discuss dilation and curettage -- what used to be the most common
abortion procedure before vacuum aspiration took its place. Vacuum aspiration
is an easier method, but sometimes remaining fetal/placental material
necessitates doing a "cleanup" D&C anyway, so you should know how to do this
procedure first.

DISCLAIMER: I am posting this as information only. Whether anyone chooses to
act upon this information is their own concern. I believe in the free exchange
of information and ideas. I believe this information has been kept from women
for too long, and there is no reason they should not know about a procedure
being performed on their own body, and no reason women should be kept in the
dark about how to perform it -- especially if someone they know is having their
health jeopardized by this law.

Instruments needed and their uses

You will need:

One set of uterine dilators (any equipment may be purchased from numerous
websites. If you need assistance in finding this equipment, do not hesitate to
email me at molly.blythe@gmail.com)
Vaginal speculum
Pregnancy test
One set of uterine curettes
One pair of uterine forceps
One pair of regular forceps
Sterile bags for medical instruments and medical waste
A course of antibiotics
Sedative medication
Pressure cooker
Container of bleach solution: one part chlorine bleach to 10 parts water
Strong soap
Sterile latex gloves
Water-based lubricant
Maxi pads
Clean plastic sheeting and towels
Exam table
Wet wipes

First, let's talk instruments, before we talk implementation:

Cervical dilators come in many forms. Some hydroscopic dilators work by
absorbing moisture from the vagina into the dilator, gradually increasing its
diameter until it is workable. However, the "old-fashioned" way is with a set
of dilators -- metal instruments of varying sizes. It would probably be best
for an illegal practitioner to use these, as they are essentially infinitely
reusable as long as they are sterilized between uses. Essentially, the
practitioner begins with the smallest instrument and inserts it into the
cervix. Then, he or she moves on to the next smallest, and so forth, until the
cervix is sufficiently dilated to allow the uterine forceps to be used. This is
the easiest part of the abortion, and one that requires very little knowledge
other than the placement of the cervix.

Uterine forceps look like a hybrid of a scissor handle and a bird of prey's
talon. Their use, once the cervix is dilated enough to allow access to the
uterus, is simple: they remove the fetal material from the uterus -- as much as
can be removed in this manner.

Curettes are perhaps the most foreign-looking of the implements used.
Essentially, they look like small spoons with sharp edges. These are used after
the uterine forceps, to make sure the rest of the fetal material and placenta
is scraped from the sides of the uterus.

A course of antibiotics is CRUCIAL. The most common cause of death post-illegal
abortion is due to infection. When your uterus has been opened up, it is more
prone to infection. Do not fool around with this: antibiotics are absolutely
necessary post-abortion. Antibiotics can be purchased from Mexican
pharmaceutical supply houses for less than $2 per course.

Now that we've discussed the more uncommon instruments, let's move on to
discussing the procedure itself.

Procedure

Sterilizing instruments is absolutely critical. The most professional way to
sterilize instruments would be with an autoclave -- but this is something to
get only if you have an extra few hundred dollars to spend in the name of
efficiency. Sterilization is no joke, and nothing to be skimped on, but you can
sterilize instruments very well with a household pressure cooker. Ordinary
boiling water does not kill all pathogens; while boiling water was the best
people could do 100 years ago, it is not the best we can do now. Check your
pressure cooker's manual carefully and figure out how much water needs to be
placed in it to stay at 250-260 degrees for 30 minutes. Be sure to refer
carefully to the manual, or injury and damage to the cooker could result. Place
the water and instruments into the pressure cooker and allow it to "cook" them
for 30 minutes at the 250-260 temperature. This will steam-sterilize your
instruments. If you have an autoclave, lucky you! Follow its operating
instructions.

Assuming you have no autoclave, follow the instructions for opening your
pressure cooker, then remove the instruments with an already-sterilized pair of
ordinary forceps. set them in the sterile bags. Now your instruments are
prepared. From now on, be sure to only touch the instruments on the handle
side, rather than on the side coming into contact with the cervix and uterus.
Wipe down your table with bleach solution, allow it to dry, and then place
clean plastic sheeting over it.

Your patient should be naked from the waist down and should have her pubic area
shaved. Request that the patient does so the night before. Administer a
sedative to the patient long enough before the procedure begins that it will be
fully effective during the D&C procedure. Prior to the procedure, conduct an
ordinary pregnancy test on the woman. This may seem like a silly step, but
pregnancy tests are never 100% accurate, and women have been known to come to
abortion clinics and test negative. Ask your patient how long it has been since
her last period. If it has been eight weeks or less, the procedure itself will
take less than 15 minutes after dilation begins. The length grows, however,
until at about 13-14 weeks (the limit for a D&C procedure because of the
limited dilation ability of dilators) it will last up to 45 minutes. Honesty is
IMPERATIVE, because dishonesty could endanger the woman's health.

Once the patient has "assumed the position" in the stirrups, wipe the vulva and
anal areas with separate wet wipes, including the labia majora and minora. Once
the patient is clean, lubricate the vagina with water-based lubricant and use
the vaginal speculum to open the vagina and examine the cervix (information on
how to use a speculum properly is widely available online and in print and does
not need to be reprinted here, but please be sure you understand how to use the
speculum prior to conducting this procedure).

The cervix is a small, round, smooth-looking muscle at the top of the vaginal
canal. Please be sure to familiarize yourself with the female reproductive
system prior to performing any procedure such as this. The cervix is the
entrance to the uterus. A non-pregnant uterus is only as big as a small pear,
but it grows bigger even in the earliest months of pregnancy -- at 8 weeks, it
is the size of a peach, and at 14 weeks, the size of a grapefruit. I didn't
make up all these fruit-sizing terms, other people did, and I apologize for
making anyone uncomfortable whilst eating fruit salad from now on.

It is important to know the approximate size of the uterus because that's where
you're headed. Get out your smallest dilator and insert it slowly and gently
into the cervix. This hurts -- it's part of why your patient is sedated.
Novocaine is sometimes injected to numb the cervix, but when you are just
starting, it is probably preferable to stay away from needles entirely. Insert
each dilator in turn. Even the largest dilator, as you will notice, doesn't
give you very much room -- less than an inch of opening. There's no way you can
see into the uterus. From here on out -- this is the scary part -- you will
have to operate on feel alone. Don't feel too afraid. Each element in the
uterus feels different from the others, and as long as you are careful and
understand exactly what the procedure involves at each step, it will not be too
difficult.

The first step is to break the membrane holding the fetus inside. You can feel
around with the forceps for it. To get an idea of what each part looks like -
- and to see the texture so that you understand better how it will feel -- I
recommend looking at books with photographs of first trimester fetuses
(personal recommendation for its astonishing photographs: A Child is Born), The
membrane should be easily broken with the forceps. Depending on how far along
the pregnancy is, varying quantities of clear or pinkish fluid may come from
the vagina. As you grasp the sac with your forceps, twist it away so that it
detaches. You will now need to remove small pieces of fetal material and
membrane from the uterus with the forceps. Some of these pieces will be
distinctly identifiable as fetal material. Save the material until the end of
the procedure on a piece of plastic, so that you can be sure the entire fetus
has been removed. If doing this sounds too ethically challenging, remember that
fetuses do not have the capacity to feel actual pain until the third trimester.
You are not "hurting" it, and it has no awareness, nor the capacity for
awareness, that you are extracting it.

This portion of the abortion procedure should not be particularly painful for
the patient.

While you are removing fetal material, you will also be removing pieces of
placenta. However, because the placenta is attached to the uterine wall -- and
because it is the blood source for the baby -- bleeding may begin at this time.
It is imperative that if bleeding begins at this point in the procedure, you do
NOT stop. Stopping the procedure and attempting to stanch the bleeding will not
work. The bleeding will stop on its own once the placenta is totally removed
from the uterus. It may be scary, but keep going.

Once you have removed most of the material that is removable, you must move on
to curettage. By now you will have felt the walls of the uterus with the
forceps, and you must move on to using the spoon-shaped curettes. Find the spot
on the uterine wall where placenta still clings -- the curette will make a
sound much like metal on metal on a clean uterine wall, but will not make the
same scraping sound on a place that still needs material removed. Scrape from
the uterine walls, scraping material toward the cervix. Use the same general
form of stroke you would use to scoop ice cream, and don't be afraid to scrape
fairly hard. Scraping softly could leave tissue behind, and if there's anything
you don't want, it's that. The other cue that will inform you the uterus is
clean is that the patient will generally report feeling a cramp when the clean
uterus is scraped, whereas a scrape of placenta will not feel as painful.
Listen to your patient and listen to your curettes.

Once the material is removed from the uterine wall, any excess bleeding will
generally slow or stop and it's uterine forceps time again. Take the remaining
material out with the forceps. Most pieces of fetal material will come out with
a simple tug on the forceps (again, don't be too afraid to use force and put a
bit of muscle into it). However, at 13-14 weeks the fetal head may be slightly
big to bring out. Pinch it with the forceps and take it out in pieces, as well.
Make absolutely sure all bone fragments are removed from the uterus, as well as
all other material. If necessary, use the curette again to remove remaining
material and repeat the procedure with forceps.

By this point, bleeding should be no more than in a normal period, and likely
quite a bit less. If the patient is still bleeding heavily at this point, get
her to a hospital -- it means you likely did not curette completely, and the
hospital will generally complete the procedure as her life is assuredly in
danger.

When you feel the curettage and removal is complete, make sure you examine the
fetal material you have already extracted. If you're missing anything obvious -
- for instance, a head -- make sure to find and remove it.

Allow your patient to rest comfortably on the table if she wishes, or to get
dressed. She will likely have some residual bleeding, so make sure you have
maxi pads on hand (I would not risk infection from tampons so soon after the
procedure). Give her the course of antibiotics and stress to her how imperative
it is that she use them as directed. Make sure that she understands any
bleeding or problems means she needs to call 911 immediately. When she is
ready, allow her to leave -- if sedated, do not allow her to drive home
herself. Follow up in a few days and make sure she is not experiencing much
bleeding or pain.

-------

I will be following up this article with directions for performing vacuum
aspiration for first-trimester pregnancies and inducing miscarriages for later
ones. I hope this can prove educational for the next generation of women, who
may have to start a second Jane program. I am sorry we live in times where it
is necessary to publish this material, but if women work together, an abortion
ban doesn't mean that women and girls are left with no choices.

Úmrtnost je minimální, viz jak Jane's, tak jiné "post-antibiotické"
andělíčkářky, takže možnost úmrtí bych rovnou vynechala.

Těmihle nástroji by mě moc nerozebrala:-) a myslím, že kdyby se o to nějaká
wannabe dojnice pokusila, tak se ubráním a rovnou jí pošlu do nebíčka za
embryjkem, samozřejmě v sebeobraně... což pokud se na tebe vrhne bába se
skalpelem, tak to sebeobrana je, a pokud se na tebe vrhne bába s gelovými
nehty, tak jí akorát zataháš za vlasy a zakroutíš jí bradavky a je vyřízená.

Já bych do andělíčkářství hned šla, myslím, že je to fakt super profese. A
nejen co se peněz týče.

Mluvit o některých věcech odjakživa nebylo považováno za korektní. Zkusme se
ale na celou věc podívat z jiného hlediska. Pokud někdo sám děti odmítá tak
bude po celý svůj život zcela závislý na cizích, postupem věku čím dál tím
víc. Jestliže nebudou mít děti ti ostatní tak musí nevyhnutelně umřít hladem
nebo být zavražděn někým méně zdegenerovaným kdo obsadí jeho území. V
nejlepším případě ho může čekat otroctví, ale to je spíš hypotetická možnost.
K tomu by navíc musel být zdravý a silný a umět kvalitně manuálně pracovat.
Bez lidí se nedá ani kupovat a prodávat, není co a komu. Výpisu z konta se
stejně nenají, i kdyby banka vydržela.
Proto by každý své sobectví měl domyslet až do konce a dělat co může aby měli
děti druzí. Podporovat je a pomáhat jim. Nad tím když někdo nenávidí děti až
bolestně kdekoliv je vidí a snaží se přemluvit k vraždění druhé zůstává stát
rozum. Podle pana profesora Tolkiena jde o tzv. zákonné zlo. Asi jako když
někdo potopí loď i za cenu vlastní smrti, jen aby se utopili ti ostatní.

No, zní to jednoduše, ale nepodceňovala bych nejméně dvě nebezpečí, krom
nějakého postihu. Za prvé, bys měla plnou hlavu starostí, pokud by ti na tom
stole zůstala mrtvola, až bys sáhla vedle a za druhé, až bys některou
vykuchala na věky věkův, což by se ti nejspíš stávalo častěji a dotyčná za pár
let zjistila, že děti přece jen chce a nemůže a hráblo by jí z toho, tak by tě
těmi nástroji taky mohla rozebrat na prvočinitele.

přiveze z Ukrajiny (tam jsou volně prodejná), za večer vyhrabu třeba tři
