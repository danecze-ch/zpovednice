    Na Ňáátko nemám, kdo ale umí anglicky, určitě se pobaví. Fakt elita.



    A couple was going out for the evening. They'd gotten ready, all dolled
    up, dog put out, etc. The taxi arrives, and as the couple start out,
    the dog shoots back in the house. They don't want the dog shut in the
    house, so the wife goes out to the taxi while the husband goes upstairs
    to chase the dog out.
    The wife, not wanting it known that the house will be empty explains to
    the taxi driver:"He's just going upstairs to say good-bye to my
    mother."A few minutes later, the husband gets into the cab.
    "Sorry I took so long" he says. "Stupid bitch was hiding under the bed
    and I had to poke her with a coat hanger to get her to come out! Then I
    had to wrap her in a blanket to keep her from scratching and biting me
    as I hauled her ass downstairs and tossed her in the back yard! She
    better not shit in the vegetable garden again either!"




    The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the
    train, looking for an empty seat. The only unoccupied seat was directly
    adjacent to well dressed middle aged lady and was being used by her
    little dog.
    The weary soldier asked, "Please, ma'am, may I sit in that seat?"
    The French woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said,
    "You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see my
    little Fifi is using that seat?"
    The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after
    another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing
    the woman with the dog.
    Again he asked, "Please, lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired."
    The French woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, "You Americans! Not
    only are you rude, you are also arrogant. Imagine!"
    The soldier didn't say another word. He leaned over, picked up the
    little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the
    empty seat.
    The woman shrieked and demanded that someone defend her and chastise
    the soldier.
    An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, "You know, sir,
    you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing.
    You're bad at holding the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your autos
    on the wrong side of the road. And now, sir, you've thrown the wrong
    bitch out of the window."



    By the time a Marine pulled into a little town, every hotel room was
    taken.
    "You've got to have a room somewhere," he pleaded. "Or just a bed, I
    don't care where."
    "Well, I do have a double room with one occupant, a Navy guy," admitted
    the manager, "and he might be glad to split the cost. But to tell you
    the truth, he snores so loudly that people in adjoining rooms have
    complained in the past. I'm not sure it'd be worth it to you."
    "No problem," the tired Marine assured him. "I'll take it."
    The next morning the Marine came down to breakfast bright-eyed and
    bushy-tailed. "How'd you sleep?" Asked the manager.
    "Never better."
    The manager was impressed. "No problem with the other guy snoring,
    then?"
    "Nope, I shut him up in no time." Said the Marine.
    "How'd you manage that?" asked the manager.
    "He was already in bed, snoring away, when I came in the room," the
    Marine explained. "I went over, gave him a kiss on the cheek, said,
    'Goodnight, beautiful,' and he sat up all night watching me."

    It's a beautiful, warm spring morning and a man and his wife are
    spending the day at the zoo. She's wearing a cute, loose-fitting, pink
    spring dress, sleeveless with straps. He's wearing his normal jeans and
    a T-shirt. The zoo is not very busy this morning.
    As they walk through the ape exhibit, they pass in front of a very
    large hairy gorilla. Noticing the girl, the gorilla goes ape. (No pun
    intended)
    He jumps up on the bars, and holding on with one hand (and 2 feet), he
    grunts and pounds his chest with his free hand. He is obviously excited
    at the pretty lady in the wavy dress.
    The husband, noticing the excitement, thinks this is funny. He suggests
    that his wife teases the poor fellow some more. The husband suggests
    she pucker her lips, wiggle her bottom at him, and play along.
    She does, and Mr. Gorilla gets even more excited, making noises that
    would wake the dead.
    Then the husband suggests that she let one of her straps fall to show a
    little more skin.
    She does, and Mr. Gorilla is about to tear the bars down.
    "Now try lifting your dress up your thighs and sort of fan it at him."
    he says.... this drives the gorilla absolutely crazy and now he's doing
    flips.
    Then the husband grabs his wife by the hair, rips open the door to the
    cage, flings her in with the gorilla and slams the cage door shut.
    "Now, tell HIM you have a headache."


    A boss of a big company needed to call one of his employees about an
    urgent problem with one of the main computers. He dialed the employee's
    home phone number and was greeted with a child's whispered, "Hello?"
    Feeling put out at the inconvenience of having to talk to the
    youngster, the boss asked, "Is your Daddy home?"
    "Yes," whispered the small voice.
    "May I talk with him?" the man asked.
    To the surprise of the boss, the small voice whispered, "No."
    Wanting to talk with an adult, the boss asked, "Is your Mommy there?"
    Yes," came the answer.
    "May I talk with her?"
    Again the small voice whispered, "No."
    Knowing that it was not likely that a young child would be left home
    alone, the boss decided he would just leave a message with the person
    who should be there watching over the child.
    "Is there anyone there besides you?" the boss asked the child.
    "Yes," whispered the child, "a policeman."
    Wondering what a cop would be doing at his employee's home, the boss
    asked, "May I speak with the policeman?"
    "No, he's busy," whispered the child.
    "Busy doing what?" asked the boss.
    "Talking to Daddy and Mommy and the Fireman," came the whispered
    answer.
    Growing concerned and even worried as he heard what sounded like a
    helicopter through the ear piece on the phone, the boss asked, "What
    is that noise?"
    "A hello-copper," answered the whispering voice.
    "What is going on there?" asked the boss, now alarmed.
    In an awed whispering voice, the child answered, "The search team
    just landed the hello-copper."
    Alarmed, concerned, and more than just a little frustrated, the boss
    asked, "What are they searching for?"
    Still whispering, the young voice replied along with a muffled
    giggle, "Me."



    COMPUTER PROBLEMS
    This is a true story from the WordPerfect helpline. Needless to say,
    the help desk employee was fired; however, he/she is currently suing
    the Word Perfect organization for "Termination without Cause."
    Actual dialogue of a former WordPerfect Customer Support employee with
    a caller:
    Customer Support: "Ridge Hall computer assistant; may I help you?"
    Caller: "Yes, well, I'm having trouble with WordPerfect."
    CS: "What sort of trouble?"
    C: "Well, I was just typing along, and all of a sudden the words went
    away."
    CS: "Went away?"
    C: "They disappeared."
    CS: "Hmm. So what does your screen look like now?"
    C: "Nothing."
    CS: "Nothing?"
    C: "It's blank; it won't accept anything when I type."
    CS: "Are you still in WordPerfect, or did you get out?"
    C: "How do I tell?"
    CS: "Can you see the C: prompt on the screen?"
    C: "What's a sea-prompt?"
    CS: "Never mind. Can you move the cursor around on the screen?"
    C: "There isn't any cursor, I told you, it won't accept anything I
    type."
    CS: "Does your monitor have a power indicator?"
    C: "What's a monitor?"
    CS: "It's the thing with the screen on it that looks like a TV. Does it
    have a little light that tells you when it's on?"
    C: "I don't know."
    CS: "Well, then look on the back of the monitor and find where the
    power cord goes into it. Can you see that?"
    C: "Yes, I think so."
    CS: "Great. Follow the cord to the plug, and tell me if it's plugged
    into the wall."
    C: ".......Yes, it is."
    CS: "When you were behind the monitor, did you notice that there were
    two cables plugged into the back of it, not just one?"
    C: "No."
    CS: "Well, there are. I need you to look back there again and find the
    other cable."
    C: ".......Okay, here it is."
    CS: "Follow it for me, and tell me if it's plugged securely into the
    back of your computer."
    C: "I can't reach."
    CS: "Uh huh. Well, can you see if it is?"
    C: "No."
    CS: "Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over?"
    C: "Oh, it's not because I don't have the right angle - it's because
    it's dark."
    CS: "Dark?"
    C: "Yes - the office light is off, and the only light I have is coming
    in from the window."
    CS: "Well, turn on the office light then."
    C: "I can't."
    CS: "No? Why not?"
    C: "Because there's a power outage."
    CS: "A power... A power outage? Ah, Okay, we've got it licked now. Do
    you still have the boxes and manuals and packing stuff your computer
    came in?"
    C: "Well, yes, I keep them in the closet."
    CS: "Good. Go get them, and unplug your system and pack it up just like
    it was when you got it. Then take it back to the store you bought it
    from."
    C: "Really? Is it that bad?"
    CS: "Yes, I'm afraid it is."
    C: "Well, all right then, I suppose. What do I tell them?"
    CS: "Tell them you're too stupid to own a computer."

    A good friend will bail you out of jail.
    A great friend will be in the cell next to you saying, "Damn, that was
    fun!"


    Enjoy!!!
