CAST 2,
---------------------------------------------------

Sean pushed himself off the tarp-covered vehicle in the driveway and gave Jim
a jive-style handshake.
“Tomorrow?” Sean asked, shooting double handguns at Jim, thumbs up, index
fingers out.

“Ah, I can’t tomorrow. I’m working the closing shift. Sunday works though. I’m
off.”

“Sweet. See you Sunday?”

“For sure.”

Jim watched Sean lope over to his car and get in. He pulled another cigarette
out of the pack and lit it. Sean revved the engine twice before peeling away
from the curb. Jim shook his head in amusement and drew on his cigarette, eyes
back on the window across the street.

The woman looked up from her dishes to watch Sean’s car drive away. Even
though he was hidden deep in the shadows where she couldn’t possibly see him,
Jim could swear she looked right at him for half a minute before she turned
away to finish her work. The woman turned out the light and he lost sight of
her.

After her house went dark, Jim stayed on the driveway, finishing his last
cigarette before heading inside to bed.

On Saturday night, Jim flicked the last switch, shutting off the lights to the
big sign out front, his final act before clocking out for the night. He locked
up the doors of the shop and headed out across the deserted parking lot. His
truck was the only vehicle nearby. The parking lot of the Mexican restaurant
across the way was packed full of Saturday night revelers but the crowd of
cars hadn’t yet spilled over near the auto shops where Jim worked.

Jim climbed into the cab of his truck, stuck the key in the ignition and fired
it up. He goosed the gas pedal several times, revving the engine, before
trusting it to stay running. While he waited for it to warm up, he lit a
cigarette and smoked half of it before dropping the transmission into drive
and pulling out of the lot.

It was late when he parked along the curb in front of his house. Jim sat in
his truck for a few minutes after cutting the engine, finishing his smoke. He
flicked the dead butt out the window before climbing out.

Instead of going inside to his room, he slammed the door of the truck and
walked to the front of it, looking toward the woman’s house. Her kitchen
window was dim but not all the way dark. Light from somewhere deep in the
house cast a faint glow through the window. It was too late for her to be up
doing housework. He leaned up against the front fender, bending one leg so he
could rest his foot against the dull chrome bumper.

Jim reached over and patted the pocket of his work shirt, feeling for his
cigarettes. Finding them, he pulled the pack out and shook one loose. He lit
it, tilting his head back as he drew the smoke into his lungs. The fingers of
his left hand spread the pocket of his work shirt open to receive the pack
from his right hand. Eyes back on her window, Jim exhaled the smoke and
thought about her.

The street was dark and quiet, his Chevy’s engine ticking as it cooled the

CAST 1,

“Jim, check it out. There she is.” Sean’s voice floated out of the darkness of
Jim’s driveway.

Jim grabbed a red shop towel and wiped his hands. Satisfied, he picked his
beer up off the edge of the truck bed and walked out of the bright garage to
where Sean stood in the dark. Across the street, illuminated in the window by
the light over her kitchen sink, was his neighbor. She worked in a steady
rhythm, cleaning the dishes and, he presumed, loading them into the
dishwasher. A pale pink t-shirt with a deep v-neck displayed her smooth, tan
skin and round breasts.

Reaching into his shirt pocket, Jim pulled a pack of cigarettes out, flipped
the top open and shook one free. Lifting the pack to his mouth, he grabbed the
cigarette with his lips. The pack went back in his pocket. He thumbed the
wheel of his lighter, drawing a quiet snick and a flame. Squinting against the
glare, Jim dipped the cigarette into the lighter’s fiery heart. A deep breath
made the tip flare briefly before morphing into a dull orange coal. Jim
savored the hit a moment before he exhaled.

His attention moved back to the faint sounds of music drifting across the
street. He watched her move in time to the beat. Night after night, he stood
in the shadows and watched her work. Until she’d moved in, he never knew that
a woman might actually enjoy doing things in the kitchen. His mother hated
cooking, cleaning, anything domestic. One of his mother’s favorite sayings
was, ‘Every damn day you people get hungry! And you want something different
every damn day!’

But, this woman, his neighbor, put music on and danced her way through her
chores. She got into it and she played it loud. Those hips of hers, they had a
life of their own. And a smile, always a smile on her face.

Jim leaned against one of the cars in his driveway. With his thumb hooked into
his pocket for support, he held his beer against his thigh, fingers curled
around the neck of the bottle. He stood deep in the shadows, smoking and just
watching.

‘What would it take?’ he wondered. ‘What could I do to get her attention?’

“Man, I’d almost live with your mom just to come out here every night and
watch her,” Sean said.

Jim’s reply was another drag on his cigarette.

“Almost,” Jim said after a moment, never taking his eyes off the window across
the street.

“What?”

“I said, ‘almost’. You’d almost live with my mother.” Taking a final drag, Jim
flicked his cigarette to the concrete and crushed it under his boot.

“Yeah, I don’t think there’s any chick out there worth living with your Ma
for, Jim.”

Jim chuckled in agreement and finished his beer.

“Hey, man. I gotta get going. I gotta be at work at seven tomorrow morning,”
Sean said.

“Alright, thanks for the help, man. We’ll have the truck running by the end of
the month.”

Pár vět mám.

Japanese business people consider it their professional duty to go out after
work with colleagues to restaurants, bars, or nightclubs.


If you are going to country where your language is not widely spoken, you can
get the reverse side of your card printed in the local language.
