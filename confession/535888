Pohled společnosti na pedofily
Zdravím vás

předem bych chtěl upozornit administrátory, že se nejedná o nic ilegálního.

Dnes bych vám chtěl ukazát tento svět očima pedofilů. Myslím, že je to celkem
zajímavé... Podívat se na to i z jiné stránky. Teď neuvidíte ten svět očima
policajta, který vám ve škole říkal, aby jste si na ně dávali pozor, protože
je to odpad společnosti, devianti, násilníci....Lidé co mají potěšení z toho
ubližovat dětem.... Možná zjistíte, že to není až tak úplně pravda.

Obrázek si udělejte sami... :-)

Ever since I was 12 years old, when I found my first snippet of
pornography on the Internet, I knew I was different. That first picture
was of a child; a little girl no older than 6 years old. I immediately
tried to find more, but to no avail. The dot-com bubble had just recently
burst, Google was in its infancy, and I had no knowledge of computers or
networks, or even that what I was looking at was illegal.

Throughout my teen years I would find a little more here and there,
through Bulletin Boards and redirect sites (not the best idea, I now
know). But after I was done doing the deed so to speak, I had a tendency
to feel bad. I would delete everything I had found, and shrugged it off
as a phase I was going through. It was a confusing time and I didn't
understand.

At age 18 I told myself I would never look at such things ever again. I
was always a loner, but that year I managed to lose my virginity and all
seemed right in the world. Nothing could prepare me for the pain of
rejection and subsequent depression I felt after several relationships
ended. The only thing that made me feel better was getting off to this
illegal perversion. But I still had the same problem of feeling bad later
and deleting whatever I had. This went on for a good two years where I
would delete everything and then re-download it all again.

As recently as two weeks ago I deleted everything I had. Then, three days
ago, I found the Tor Network, and specifically, PedoBoard. I read
countless posts about people sharing the same interests as me and
suddenly I had a revelation: I am not alone. I was on the brink of tears
as I chatted with the first person I added to TorChat. To be able to talk
to someone, anyone, about something that you keep bottled up inside for
fear of being caught is the most liberating experience I have ever had.

A weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I feel confident to finally
admit it and not feel completely terrible about my interests.

My name is Perry Cox and I am a pedophile.

I started looking at kiddy porn ever since I could obtain a computer way
back when i was 14. I'm 2 years older than u Perry so we started about
the same time!!
I knew I would always love these young girls, how Jehovah could create
such beautiful nimble creatures is utterly amazing, and yes like a flower
we should wait on dipping in their "nectar"!!
He told man to multiply and b fruitful, so even at my current age, and
age back then I knew that wanting these lil nymphs was a natural thing
for any guys, and older one's that i would turn into eventually.

I also had the gut feeling of deleting the evidence soon after I "used"
it. This is called the conscious, yet it is a human nature to sin and be
fearful of what society has played off as unmoral.

1st Corinthians 7:36 says we do not sin just as long as our burning
"hearts" (desires) are resolved with marriage.
In my own life I have alwayz dated younger gurls, and have gotten in
plenty of trouble mainly because they are white, and I'm mixed. Its sad
to say that we still live in a society that is so ignorant.

The people you find here, in most respects don't LOVE little girls or
boys enough to want to marry them, which is a totally different
discussion for later on.
Some of them do, and understand a child's right to participate or not.
Its all about how you approach youngsters. You really have to show them
they are equal to you, but that you may know a little more because you've
been living longer...
Also in my life I have been opened to the majority of my family and
friends on my beliefs. Once you stand firm in a belief its hard for your
REAL loved one's to go with Societies fake ass morals that Jehovah was
never against.

I have found several older gurls (women) who would particpate in my plan.
It is a very elaborate one, and most bi-sexual women are interested like
I am.
Adopt a young girl, spoil her to death, and show her what real love,
loyalty, and honesty is. That way when she is 15 or 16 she won't be
brainwashed by asswholes.

:D Glad you found your way here! As you can see, many of us have a
similar story as yours. Mine started when I was aroun 19 or 20, but I
remember being attracted to 10-12 year olds when I was a teenager and
thinking I must be rather strange :)

Hi PerryCox,
Nice you finally managed coming out to yourself, congratulations. I hope
that cycle of downloading and deleting is over now for you!
I just hope you have TrueCrypt? :)

About me, I always was into little ones somehow, but I managed for a
(today surprisingly) long time to tell myself that it was just a phase,
or just an irrelevant marginal attraction. Just looking in the mirror and
saying the "bad p-word" was an incredibly hard thing to do. Also I'm
religious (not quite as fanatic as PYTlover though...), and it took quite
a while for me to confess my orientation in my prayers.
That coming-out to myself was at age 22. It was mainly triggered by
discovering bigger amounts of CP on the web; I saw all this material and
realized that it actually was these little girls that I care about most
in life, and that I longed for a sexual relationship with them.
At this time I also found the TOR community and met other people like me
online on torchat. That was a very interesting experience, and it helped
me to adjust my ethical framework (and religious world view) to my
orientation; but somehow I still felt alone on this planet.
My family being very close to me, it still took me another 2 years of
double-life before I finally came out to them. Their understanding and
acceptance are the best things I experienced in my life.

@PYTlover:
I'm not that bible-safe but I think that Corinthians verse meant that you
should marry and fuck the same woman - unlike your plan of marrying woman
A and fucking girl B! ;)
Twisting bible verses to your own advantage doesn't make you better than
those who use the bible to discriminate us.
I believe that God creates us the way he wants - including our sexual
orientation - and that he wants us to live a happy life together with the
people that we meet. Therefore I think it is possible for adults and
children to enjoy sex together without anyone getting hurt or
traumatized. I can't believe that he'd just put us in this world as a bad
example for others, or so people might develop a group feeling while
hunting us down. Or because he has a morbid sense of humor.

PerryCox, please put your torchat id in your sig so I can add you :) or
simply add me :)

It is so important that you can understand that there are undoubtedly
millions of pedophiles across the world - we welcome you! The current
levels of persecution of pedophiles indicate and underlying problem -
that western society (for instance) is not willing to accept anything
that it considers to be the 'norm' and is just as prejudiced and bigoted
as many religious or political dictatorships - and not willing to listen
to reason or common sense for that matter.

Pedophilia is a sexual orientation - not a mental illness. I do not WANT
to be cured - I am who I am even though my sexual preferences cause me
problems almost every day. Just because I am sexually attracted to
children does not mean that I am going to hurt them - quite the opposite!
On the rare occasions that I have touched a child in a sexual way - it
was very important to me that the child enjoyed the experience and was
not in any way forced into it. I am happy to say that almost all of the
children I have touched experienced an orgasm and seemed to thoroughly
enjoy the experience. The pedo-bashers - foaming at the mouth - do not
realise this. They assume that all pedophiles are a danger to children -
nothing could be further from the truth!

I am not either a rapist or a murderer or even someone who forces anyone
(child or adult) into sexual experiences against their will. Sure I might
FANTASIZE about it - but so do many heterosexual or homosexual men and
women.

Accept who you are and enjoy your sexuality - just for goodness sake be
CAREFUL. Law enforcement agencies would like nothing better than to round
us all up into some sort of concentration camp (like Jews in the Second
World War) and imprison us forever or castrate us all. We must not let
them win.

Enjoy child pornography BUT encrypt everything (e.g. with Truecrypt -
http://truecrypt.org ). Use Tor for ALL sex related web browsing - even
non-pedophilia related things, Even better use Freenet
(http://freenetproject.org/ ) and Frost (http://jtcfrost.sourceforge.net/
- like Usenet but on Freenet) as it is much safer than even Tor.

Keep safe - be happy with who you are - and cum buckets looking at little
hairless pussies (or little cocks whatever your preference) :)

well actually to be correct about the verse it talks about how a father
should feel towards his virgin daughter... though if you go back to the
original translations it does not say father, but man; and virgin could
mean daughter or engaged fiance'. I don't debate bible because it takes
away from its true purpose but I just want to explain my thoughts and why
I feel Jehovah meant what others interpret differently.
Everybody knows god created man to multiply and be fruitful, and never
said anything about having more then one wife. Adultery (which is
deceitfulness in an affair) started to come about in Sodom and Gamor,
which implemented laws that God saw fit to keep us from sinning so much.
It is our goal to understand love, and not to make it lustfulness. The
later laws of adultry in the 10 commandments were re-appealed with the
new laws of Jesus; thow shall love your neighbor as yourself, and Jehovah
with all your heart and soul.
With the death of Jesus and St. Paul learning this love, he tells us we
should submit ourselves to our husband ( Jesus Christ). In the same way
we can love our female wives, and still have more than one wife. Loyalty
is of God, and jealousy is not. I'm sure Moses and other biblical
characters taught that to their wives with love, equally.
So in essence had we not been irresponsible and lustful, God would have
never implemented the law of adultery. But he had to because we were
committing it against him as well.
In romans or another part of Paul's letters it says we don't need law (10
commandments) if we live in truth which is the holy spirit. Also we can
live in perfection as Jesus did if he lives in us daily. though it is
virtually impossible to do with sin knocking every chance it gets.

Also I'm not a fanatic of the bible as I am with Jehovah. I'm not bias
towards the Koran, or any other religion because everything comes from
one source in the end. Some are mis-informed but I still listen and ask
the little voice in my head to make the best of it in any situation. Even
Satan worship is informative if your not weak. All things have been made
to edify Jehovah.
Yes subjecting yourself to too much of anything is bad for the soul. Even
God himself, because we were giving a choice.
Last but not least Peace be with us all...
:-)

Welcome :) When I was in my early teens, I found myself faking interest
in all the big boobed models my friends loved. I didn't know why I was
different and how. Then at 15 I discovered the internet, saw my first
pics, and was immediately hooked. I would lock myself in my room all day
just searching and searching, feeling the most intense pleasure I ever
had. Like you, though, I felt bad much of the time, and would always
delete everything.

I still go through that cycle, but less regularly. It's wonderful to have
a place like this, and I hope that I will find some good friendships
here, people with whom I can actually be myself.

Once again, welcome!

Jinak pokud jde o pedofily, kteří NIKOMU neubližují a "jen se koukají" na ty

Ty si myslíš, že když se JEN podívají na video nebo na fotky, tak nikomu
neubližují? Víš, ono se to video nebo ty fotky museli první udělat, a kvůli
tomu byly zneužity děti! Takže možná z toho potěšení nemají, ale dětem
ubližují! Jakožto matka bych takovýhle poslala na léčení.
