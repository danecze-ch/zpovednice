   God went to the Arabs and said, "I have Commandments for you that will
   make your lives better.
   The Arabs asked, "What are Commandments?"
   And the Lord said, "They are rules for living."
   "Can you give us an example?"
   "Thou shall not kill."
   "Not kill?
   We're not interested."
   So He went to the Blacks and said, "I have Commandments."
   The Blacks wanted an example, and the Lord said,
   "Honor thy Father and Mother."
   "Father? We don't know who our fathers are."
   We're not interested.
   Then He went to the Mexicans and said, "I have Commandments."
   The Mexicans also wanted an example, and the Lord said
   "Thou shall not steal."
   "Not steal?
   We're not interested."
   Then He went to the French and said, "I have Commandments."
   The French too wanted an example and the Lord said,
   "Thou shall not commit adultery."
   "Not commit adultery?
   We're not interested."
   Finally, He went to the Jews and said, "I have Commandments."
   "Commandments? " They said,
   "How much are they?"
   "They're free."
   "We'll take 10.”

   An elderly Italian Jewish man wanted to unburden his guilty conscience
   by talking to his Rabbi. "Rabbi, during World War II, when the Germans
   entered Italy, I pretended to be a 'goy" and changed my name from Levi
   to Spamoni and I am alive today because of it."
   "Self preservation is important and the fact that you never forgot that
   you were a Jew is admirable," said the Rabbi.
   "Rabbi, a beautiful Jewish woman knocked on my door and asked me to hide
   her from the Germans. I hid her in my attic and they never found her."
   "That was a wonderful thing you did and you have no need to feel
   guilty."
   "It's worse Rabbi. I was weak and allowed her to repay me for my efforts
   with her sexual favours."
   "You were both in great danger and would have suffered terribly if the
   Germans had found her. There is a favourable balance between good and
   evil and you will be judged kindly. Give up your feelings of guilt."
   "Thank you, Rabbi. That's a great load off my mind. But I have one more
   question."
   "And what is that?"
   "Should I tell her the war is over?"
   A female TV reporter arranged for an interview with a farmer, seeking
   the main cause of Mad Cow disease.
   The Lady: "Good evening, sir. I am here to collect information on the
   possible source of Mad Cow Disease. Can you offer any reason for this
   disease?"
   The Farmer stared at the reporter and said: "Do you know that a bull
   mounts a cow only once a year?"
   The lady reporter (obviously embarrassed):" Well, sir, that's a new
   piece of information, but what's the relation between this phenomenon
   and Mad Cow disease?"
   The Farmer: "And, madam, do you know that we milk a cow twice a day?"
   The reporter: "Sir, this is really valuable information, but what
   about getting to the point?"
   The Farmer: "I am getting to the point, madam. Just imagine, if I was
   playing with your tits twice a day and only
   screwing you once a year, wouldn't you get mad?"

   A burglar broke into a house one night. He picked up a CD player to
   place in his sack and a strange, disembodied voice echoed from the dark,
   saying, "Jesus is watching you."
   He nearly jumped out of his skin, clicked his flashlight off, and froze.
   When he heard nothing more after a bit, he shook his head, clicked the
   light on, and began searching for more valuables. Just as he pulled the
   stereo out so he could disconnect the wires, he heard, "Jesus is
   watching you."
   Freaked out, he shined his light around frantically, looking for the
   source of the voice. Finally, in the corner of the room, his flashlight
   beam came to rest on a parrot. "Did you say that?" he hissed at the
   parrot "Yep," the parrot confessed, then squawked, "I'm just trying to
   warn you."
   The burglar relaxed. "Warn me, huh? Who in the world are you?"
   "Moses," replied the bird. "Moses?" the burglar laughed.
   "What kind of people would name a bird Moses?"
   "The kind of people that would name a rottweiler Jesus."
   The only cow in a small Kentucky town stopped giving milk. The people
   did some research and found that they could buy a cow just across the
   state line in Illinois for $200.
   They brought the cow from Illinois and the cow was wonderful. It
   produced lots of milk all of the time, and the people were very happy.
   They decided to acquire a bull to mate with the cow to produce more cows
   like it. They would never have to worry about their milk supply again.
   They bought the bull and put it in the pasture with their beloved cow.
   However, whenever the bull tried to mount the cow, the cow would move
   away. No matter what approach the bull tried, the cow would move away
   from the bull and he could not succeed in his quest. The people were
   very upset and decided to ask the Vet, who was very wise, what to do.
   They told the Vet what was happening. "Whenever the bull tries to mount
   our cow, she moves away. If he approaches from the back, she moves
   forward. When he approaches her from the front, she backs off. An
   attempt from the side, she walks away to the other side."
   The Vet thought about this for a minute and asked, "Did you by chance,
   buy this cow in Illinois?"
   The people were dumbfounded, since no one had ever mentioned where they
   bought the cow. "You are truly a wise Vet," they said. "How did you know
   we got the cow in Illinois?"
   The Vet replied with a distant look in his eye, "My wife is from
   Illinois."
   An amish woman and her daughter were riding in an old buggy one cold
   blustery day. The daughter said to her mother, "My hands are freezing
   cold." the mother replied "Put them between your legs. Your body heat
   will warm them up." The daughter did and her hands warmed up.
   The next day the daughter was riding with her boyfriend who said, "My
   hands are freezing cold." The girl replied, "Put them between my legs.
   The warmth of my body will warm them up." He did and warmed his hands.
   The following day the boyfriend was again in the buggy with the
   daughter. He said, "My nose is cold." The girl replied "Put it between
   my legs. The warmth of my body will warm it up." He did and warmed his
   nose. The next day the boyfriend was again driving with the daughter and
   he said, "My penis is frozen solid."
   The following day the daughter was driving in the buggy with her mother,
   and she says to her mother, "Have you ever heard of a penis?" Slightly
   concerned the mother said, "Why, yes. Why do you ask?" The daughter
   replies, "They make one hell of a mess when they defrost, don't they?"
   An old Arab lived close to New York City for more than 40 years. He
   would have loved to plant potatoes in his garden, but he is alone, old
   and weak. His son is in college in Paris, so the old man sends him an e-
   mail. He explains the problem:
   "Beloved son, I am very sad, because I can't plant potatoes in my
   garden. I am sure, if only you were here, you would help and dig up the
   garden for me.
   I love you,
   Your Father"
   The following day, the old man receives a response e-mail from his son:
   "Beloved Father,
   Please don't touch the garden. It's there that I have hidden 'the
   THING'.
   I love you, too,
   Ahmed"
   At 4pm the US Army, The Marines, the FBI, the CIA and the Rangers visit
   the house of the old man, take the whole garden apart, search every
   inch, but can't find anything. Disappointed they leave the house.

   A day later, the old man receives another e-mail from his son.

   "Beloved Father,
   I hope the garden is dug up by now and you can plant your potatoes.
   That's all I could do for you from here.
   I love you,
   Ahmed."
