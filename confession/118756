Preface
Intended Audience

The FreeBSD newcomer will find that the first section of this book guides the
user through the FreeBSD installation process and gently introduces the
concepts and conventions that underpin UNIX®. Working through this section
requires little more than the desire to explore, and the ability to take on
board new concepts as they are introduced.

Once you have traveled this far, the second, far larger, section of the
Handbook is a comprehensive reference to all manner of topics of interest to
FreeBSD system administrators. Some of these chapters may recommend that you
do some prior reading, and this is noted in the synopsis at the beginning of
each chapter.

For a list of additional sources of information, please see Appendix B.
Changes from the Second Edition

This third edition is the culmination of over two years of work by the
dedicated members of the FreeBSD Documentation Project. The following are the
major changes in this new edition:

*

Chapter 11, Configuration and Tuning, has been expanded with new information
about the ACPI power and resource management, the cron system utility, and
more kernel tuning options.
*

Chapter 14, Security, has been expanded with new information about virtual
private networks (VPNs), file system access control lists (ACLs), and security
advisories.
*

Chapter 15, Mandatory Access Control (MAC), is a new chapter with this
edition. It explains what MAC is and how this mechanism can be used to secure
a FreeBSD system.
*

Chapter 17, Storage, has been expanded with new information about USB storage
devices, file system snapshots, file system quotas, file and network backed
filesystems, and encrypted disk partitions.
*

Chapter 19, Vinum, is a new chapter with this edition. It describes how to use
Vinum, a logical volume manager which provides device-independent logical
disks, and software RAID-0, RAID-1 and RAID-5.
*

Chapter 22, NanoBSD, is a new chapter with this edition. It describes how to
use NanoBSD, a tool that can create system images of FreeBSD, suitable for use
in embedded systems, Compact Flash media, etc.
*

A troubleshooting section has been added to Chapter 24, PPP and SLIP.
*

Chapter 25, Electronic Mail, has been expanded with new information about
using alternative transport agents, SMTP authentication, UUCP, fetchmail,
procmail, and other advanced topics.
*

Chapter 26, Network Servers, is all new with this edition. This chapter
includes information about setting up the Apache HTTP Server, FTPd, and
setting up a server for Microsoft Windows clients with Samba. Some sections
from Chapter 28, Advanced Networking, were moved here to improve the
presentation.
*

Chapter 28, Advanced Networking, has been expanded with new information about
using Bluetooth devices with FreeBSD, setting up wireless networks, and
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networking.
*

A glossary has been added to provide a central location for the definitions of
technical terms used throughout the book.
*

A number of aesthetic improvements have been made to the tables and figures
throughout the book.

The second edition was the culmination of over two years of work by the
dedicated members of the FreeBSD Documentation Project. The following were the
major changes in this edition:

*

A complete Index has been added.
*

All ASCII figures have been replaced by graphical diagrams.
*

A standard synopsis has been added to each chapter to give a quick summary of
what information the chapter contains, and what the reader is expected to
know.
*

The content has been logically reorganized into three parts: “Getting
Started”, “System Administration”, and “Appendices”.
*

Chapter 2 (“Installing FreeBSD”) was completely rewritten with many
screenshots to make it much easier for new users to grasp the text.
*

Chapter 3 (“UNIX Basics”) has been expanded to contain additional information
about processes, daemons, and signals.
*

Chapter 4 (“Installing Applications”) has been expanded to contain additional
information about binary package management.
*

Chapter 5 (“The X Window System”) has been completely rewritten with an
emphasis on using modern desktop technologies such as KDE and GNOME on
XFree86™ 4.X.
*

Chapter 12 (“The FreeBSD Booting Process”) has been expanded.
*

Chapter 17 (“Storage”) has been written from what used to be two separate
chapters on “Disks” and “Backups”. We feel that the topics are easier to
comprehend when presented as a single chapter. A section on RAID (both
hardware and software) has also been added.
*

Chapter 23 (“Serial Communications”) has been completely reorganized and
updated for FreeBSD 4.X/5.X.
*

Chapter 24 (“PPP and SLIP”) has been substantially updated.
*

Many new sections have been added to Chapter 28 (“Advanced Networking”).
*

Chapter 25 (“Electronic Mail”) has been expanded to include more information
about configuring sendmail.
*

Chapter 10 (“Linux® Compatibility”) has been expanded to include information
about installing Oracle® and SAP® R/3®.
*

The following new topics are covered in this second edition:
o

Configuration and Tuning (Chapter 11).
o

Multimedia (Chapter 7)

Organization of This Book

This book is split into five logically distinct sections. The first section,
Getting Started, covers the installation and basic usage of FreeBSD. It is
expected that the reader will follow these chapters in sequence, possibly
skipping chapters covering familiar topics. The second section, Common Tasks,
covers some frequently used features of FreeBSD. This section, and all
subsequent sections, can be read out of order. Each chapter begins with a
succinct synopsis that describes what the chapter covers and what the reader
is expected to already know. This is meant to allow the casual reader to skip
around to find chapters of interest. The third section, System Administration,
covers administration topics. The fourth section, Network Communication,
covers networking and server topics. The fifth section contains appendices of
reference information.

Acknowledgments

The book you are holding represents the efforts of many hundreds of people
around the world. Whether they sent in fixes for typos, or submitted complete
chapters, all the contributions have been useful.

Several companies have supported the development of this document by paying
authors to work on it full-time, paying for publication, etc. In particular,
BSDi (subsequently acquired by Wind River Systems) paid members of the FreeBSD
Documentation Project to work on improving this book full time leading up to
the publication of the first printed edition in March 2000 (ISBN 1-57176-241-
8). Wind River Systems then paid several additional authors to make a number
of improvements to the print-output infrastructure and to add additional
chapters to the text. This work culminated in the publication of the second
printed edition in November 2001 (ISBN 1-57176-303-1). In 2003-2004, FreeBSD
Mall, Inc, paid several contributors to improve the Handbook in preparation
for the third printed edition.

1.1 Synopsis

Thank you for your interest in FreeBSD! The following chapter covers various
aspects of the FreeBSD Project, such as its history, goals, development model,
and so on.

After reading this chapter, you will know:

*

How FreeBSD relates to other computer operating systems.
*

The history of the FreeBSD Project.
*

The goals of the FreeBSD Project.
*

The basics of the FreeBSD open-source development model.
*

And of course: where the name “FreeBSD” comes from.

1.2 Welcome to FreeBSD!

FreeBSD is a 4.4BSD-Lite based operating system for Intel (x86 and Itanium®),
AMD64, Alpha™, Sun UltraSPARC® computers. Ports to other architectures are
also underway. You can also read about the history of FreeBSD, or the current
release. If you are interested in contributing something to the Project (code,
hardware, unmarked bills), see the Contributing to FreeBSD article.
1.2.1 What Can FreeBSD Do?

FreeBSD has many noteworthy features. Some of these are:

*

Preemptive multitasking with dynamic priority adjustment to ensure smooth and
fair sharing of the computer between applications and users, even under the
heaviest of loads.
*

Multi-user facilities which allow many people to use a FreeBSD system
simultaneously for a variety of things. This means, for example, that system
peripherals such as printers and tape drives are properly shared between all
users on the system or the network and that individual resource limits can be
placed on users or groups of users, protecting critical system resources from
over-use.
*

Strong TCP/IP networking with support for industry standards such as SLIP,
PPP, NFS, DHCP, and NIS. This means that your FreeBSD machine can interoperate
easily with other systems as well as act as an enterprise server, providing
vital functions such as NFS (remote file access) and email services or putting
your organization on the Internet with WWW, FTP, routing and firewall
(security) services.
*

Memory protection ensures that applications (or users) cannot interfere with
each other. One application crashing will not affect others in any way.
*

FreeBSD is a 32-bit operating system (64-bit on the Alpha, Itanium, AMD64, and
UltraSPARC) and was designed as such from the ground up.
*

The industry standard X Window System (X11R6) provides a graphical user
interface (GUI) for the cost of a common VGA card and monitor and comes with
full sources.
*

Binary compatibility with many programs built for Linux, SCO, SVR4, BSDI and
NetBSD.
*

Thousands of ready-to-run applications are available from the FreeBSD ports
and packages collection. Why search the net when you can find it all right
here?
*

Thousands of additional and easy-to-port applications are available on the
Internet. FreeBSD is source code compatible with most popular commercial UNIX
systems and thus most applications require few, if any, changes to compile.
*

Demand paged virtual memory and “merged VM/buffer cache” design efficiently
satisfies applications with large appetites for memory while still maintaining
interactive response to other users.
*

SMP support for machines with multiple CPUs.
*

A full complement of C, C++, and Fortran development tools. Many additional
languages for advanced research and development are also available in the
ports and packages collection.
*

Source code for the entire system means you have the greatest degree of
control over your environment. Why be locked into a proprietary solution at
the mercy of your vendor when you can have a truly open system?
*

Extensive online documentation.
*

And many more!

FreeBSD is based on the 4.4BSD-Lite release from Computer Systems Research
Group (CSRG) at the University of California at Berkeley, and carries on the
distinguished tradition of BSD systems development. In addition to the fine
work provided by CSRG, the FreeBSD Project has put in many thousands of hours
in fine tuning the system for maximum performance and reliability in real-life
load situations. As many of the commercial giants struggle to field PC
operating systems with such features, performance and reliability, FreeBSD can
offer them now!

The applications to which FreeBSD can be put are truly limited only by your
own imagination. From software development to factory automation, inventory
control to azimuth correction of remote satellite antennae; if it can be done
with a commercial UNIX product then it is more than likely that you can do it
with FreeBSD too! FreeBSD also benefits significantly from literally thousands
of high quality applications developed by research centers and universities
around the world, often available at little to no cost. Commercial
applications are also available and appearing in greater numbers every day.

Because the source code for FreeBSD itself is generally available, the system
can also be customized to an almost unheard of degree for special applications
or projects, and in ways not generally possible with operating systems from
most major commercial vendors. Here is just a sampling of some of the
applications in which people are currently using FreeBSD:

*

Internet Services: The robust TCP/IP networking built into FreeBSD makes it an
ideal platform for a variety of Internet services such as:
o

FTP servers
o

World Wide Web servers (standard or secure [SSL])
o

Firewalls and NAT (“IP masquerading”) gateways
o

Electronic Mail servers
o

USENET News or Bulletin Board Systems
o

And more...

With FreeBSD, you can easily start out small with an inexpensive 386 class PC
and upgrade all the way up to a quad-processor Xeon with RAID storage as your
enterprise grows.
*

Education: Are you a student of computer science or a related engineering
field? There is no better way of learning about operating systems, computer
architecture and networking than the hands on, under the hood experience that
FreeBSD can provide. A number of freely available CAD, mathematical and
graphic design packages also make it highly useful to those whose primary
interest in a computer is to get other work done!
*

Research: With source code for the entire system available, FreeBSD is an
excellent platform for research in operating systems as well as other branches
of computer science. FreeBSD's freely available nature also makes it possible
for remote groups to collaborate on ideas or shared development without having
to worry about special licensing agreements or limitations on what may be
discussed in open forums.
*

Networking: Need a new router? A name server (DNS)? A firewall to keep people
out of your internal network? FreeBSD can easily turn that unused 386 or 486
PC sitting in the corner into an advanced router with sophisticated packet-
filtering capabilities.
*

X Window workstation: FreeBSD is a fine choice for an inexpensive X terminal
solution, either using the freely available X11 server or one of the excellent
commercial servers provided by Xi Graphics. Unlike an X terminal, FreeBSD
allows many applications to be run locally if desired, thus relieving the
burden on a central server. FreeBSD can even boot “diskless”, making
individual workstations even cheaper and easier to administer.
*

Software Development: The basic FreeBSD system comes with a full complement of
development tools including the renowned GNU C/C++ compiler and debugger.

FreeBSD is available in both source and binary form on CDROM, DVD, and via
anonymous FTP. Please see Appendix A for more information about obtaining
FreeBSD.

1.3 About the FreeBSD Project

The following section provides some background information on the project,
including a brief history, project goals, and the development model of the
project.
1.3.1 A Brief History of FreeBSD
Contributed by Jordan Hubbard.

The FreeBSD project had its genesis in the early part of 1993, partially as an
outgrowth of the “Unofficial 386BSD Patchkit” by the patchkit's last 3
coordinators: Nate Williams, Rod Grimes and myself.

Our original goal was to produce an intermediate snapshot of 386BSD in order
to fix a number of problems with it that the patchkit mechanism just was not
capable of solving. Some of you may remember the early working title for the
project being “386BSD 0.5” or “386BSD Interim” in reference to that fact.

386BSD was Bill Jolitz's operating system, which had been up to that point
suffering rather severely from almost a year's worth of neglect. As the
patchkit swelled ever more uncomfortably with each passing day, we were in
unanimous agreement that something had to be done and decided to assist Bill
by providing this interim “cleanup” snapshot. Those plans came to a rude halt
when Bill Jolitz suddenly decided to withdraw his sanction from the project
without any clear indication of what would be done instead.

It did not take us long to decide that the goal remained worthwhile, even
without Bill's support, and so we adopted the name “FreeBSD”, coined by David
Greenman. Our initial objectives were set after consulting with the system's
current users and, once it became clear that the project was on the road to
perhaps even becoming a reality, I contacted Walnut Creek CDROM with an eye
toward improving FreeBSD's distribution channels for those many unfortunates
without easy access to the Internet. Walnut Creek CDROM not only supported the
idea of distributing FreeBSD on CD but also went so far as to provide the
project with a machine to work on and a fast Internet connection. Without
Walnut Creek CDROM's almost unprecedented degree of faith in what was, at the
time, a completely unknown project, it is quite unlikely that FreeBSD would
have gotten as far, as fast, as it has today.

The first CDROM (and general net-wide) distribution was FreeBSD 1.0, released
in December of 1993. This was based on the 4.3BSD-Lite (“Net/2”) tape from
U.C. Berkeley, with many components also provided by 386BSD and the Free
Software Foundation. It was a fairly reasonable success for a first offering,
and we followed it with the highly successful FreeBSD 1.1 release in May of
1994.

Around this time, some rather unexpected storm clouds formed on the horizon as
Novell and U.C. Berkeley settled their long-running lawsuit over the legal
status of the Berkeley Net/2 tape. A condition of that settlement was U.C.
Berkeley's concession that large parts of Net/2 were “encumbered” code and the
property of Novell, who had in turn acquired it from AT&T some time
previously. What Berkeley got in return was Novell's “blessing” that the
4.4BSD-Lite release, when it was finally released, would be declared
unencumbered and all existing Net/2 users would be strongly encouraged to
switch. This included FreeBSD, and the project was given until the end of July
1994 to stop shipping its own Net/2 based product. Under the terms of that
agreement, the project was allowed one last release before the deadline, that
release being FreeBSD 1.1.5.1.

FreeBSD then set about the arduous task of literally re-inventing itself from
a completely new and rather incomplete set of 4.4BSD-Lite bits. The “Lite”
releases were light in part because Berkeley's CSRG had removed large chunks
of code required for actually constructing a bootable running system (due to
various legal requirements) and the fact that the Intel port of 4.4 was highly
incomplete. It took the project until November of 1994 to make this
transition, at which point it released FreeBSD 2.0 to the net and on CDROM (in
late December). Despite being still more than a little rough around the edges,
the release was a significant success and was followed by the more robust and
easier to install FreeBSD 2.0.5 release in June of 1995.

We released FreeBSD 2.1.5 in August of 1996, and it appeared to be popular
enough among the ISP and commercial communities that another release along the
2.1-STABLE branch was merited. This was FreeBSD 2.1.7.1, released in February
1997 and capping the end of mainstream development on 2.1-STABLE. Now in
maintenance mode, only security enhancements and other critical bug fixes will
be done on this branch (RELENG_2_1_0).

FreeBSD 2.2 was branched from the development mainline (“-CURRENT”) in
November 1996 as the RELENG_2_2 branch, and the first full release (2.2.1) was
released in April 1997. Further releases along the 2.2 branch were done in the
summer and fall of '97, the last of which (2.2.8) appeared in November 1998.
The first official 3.0 release appeared in October 1998 and spelled the
beginning of the end for the 2.2 branch.

The tree branched again on Jan 20, 1999, leading to the 4.0-CURRENT and 3.X-
STABLE branches. From 3.X-STABLE, 3.1 was released on February 15, 1999, 3.2
on May 15, 1999, 3.3 on September 16, 1999, 3.4 on December 20, 1999, and 3.5
on June 24, 2000, which was followed a few days later by a minor point release
update to 3.5.1, to incorporate some last-minute security fixes to Kerberos.
This will be the final release in the 3.X branch.

There was another branch on March 13, 2000, which saw the emergence of the
4.X-STABLE branch. There have been several releases from it so far: 4.0-
RELEASE was introduced in March 2000, and the last 4.11-RELEASE came out in
January 2005.

The long-awaited 5.0-RELEASE was announced on January 19, 2003. The
culmination of nearly three years of work, this release started FreeBSD on the
path of advanced multiprocessor and application thread support and introduced
support for the UltraSPARC and ia64 platforms. This release was followed by
5.1 in June of 2003. The last 5.X release from -CURRENT branch was 5.2.1-
RELEASE, introduced in February 2004.

RELENG_5 branch created in August 2004, followed by 5.3-RELEASE, that marks
beginning of the 5-STABLE branch releases. The most recent 5.4-RELEASE came
out in May 2005. There will be additional releases from the RELENG_5 branch.

Tree was branched in July 2005, for RELENG_6. 6.0-RELEASE, the first release
of the 6.X branch was released in November 2005. The most recent 6.1-RELEASE
came out in May 2006. There will be additional releases from the RELENG_6
branch.

For now, long-term development projects continue to take place in the 7.X-
CURRENT (trunk) branch, and SNAPshot releases of 7.X on CDROM (and, of course,
on the net) are continually made available from the snapshot server as work
progresses.
1.3.2 FreeBSD Project Goals
Contributed by Jordan Hubbard.

The goals of the FreeBSD Project are to provide software that may be used for
any purpose and without strings attached. Many of us have a significant
investment in the code (and project) and would certainly not mind a little
financial compensation now and then, but we are definitely not prepared to
insist on it. We believe that our first and foremost “mission” is to provide
code to any and all comers, and for whatever purpose, so that the code gets
the widest possible use and provides the widest possible benefit. This is, I
believe, one of the most fundamental goals of Free Software and one that we
enthusiastically support.

That code in our source tree which falls under the GNU General Public License
(GPL) or Library General Public License (LGPL) comes with slightly more
strings attached, though at least on the side of enforced access rather than
the usual opposite. Due to the additional complexities that can evolve in the
commercial use of GPL software we do, however, prefer software submitted under
the more relaxed BSD copyright when it is a reasonable option to do so.
1.3.3 The FreeBSD Development Model
Contributed by Satoshi Asami.

The development of FreeBSD is a very open and flexible process, being
literally built from the contributions of hundreds of people around the world,
as can be seen from our list of contributors. FreeBSD's development
infrastructure allow these hundreds of developers to collaborate over the
Internet. We are constantly on the lookout for new developers and ideas, and
those interested in becoming more closely involved with the project need
simply contact us at the FreeBSD technical discussions mailing list. The
FreeBSD announcements mailing list is also available to those wishing to make
other FreeBSD users aware of major areas of work.

Useful things to know about the FreeBSD project and its development process,
whether working independently or in close cooperation:

The CVS repository

The central source tree for FreeBSD is maintained by CVS (Concurrent Versions
System), a freely available source code control tool that comes bundled with
FreeBSD. The primary CVS repository resides on a machine in Santa Clara CA,
USA from where it is replicated to numerous mirror machines throughout the
world. The CVS tree, which contains the -CURRENT and -STABLE trees, can all be
easily replicated to your own machine as well. Please refer to the
Synchronizing your source tree section for more information on doing this.
The committers list

The committers are the people who have write access to the CVS tree, and are
authorized to make modifications to the FreeBSD source (the term “committer”
comes from the cvs(1) commit command, which is used to bring new changes into
the CVS repository). The best way of making submissions for review by the
committers list is to use the send-pr(1) command. If something appears to be
jammed in the system, then you may also reach them by sending mail to the
FreeBSD committer's mailing list.
The FreeBSD core team

The FreeBSD core team would be equivalent to the board of directors if the
FreeBSD Project were a company. The primary task of the core team is to make
sure the project, as a whole, is in good shape and is heading in the right
directions. Inviting dedicated and responsible developers to join our group of
committers is one of the functions of the core team, as is the recruitment of
new core team members as others move on. The current core team was elected
from a pool of committer candidates in July 2004. Elections are held every 2
years.

Some core team members also have specific areas of responsibility, meaning
that they are committed to ensuring that some large portion of the system
works as advertised. For a complete list of FreeBSD developers and their areas
of responsibility, please see the Contributors List

Note: Most members of the core team are volunteers when it comes to FreeBSD
development and do not benefit from the project financially, so “commitment”
should also not be misconstrued as meaning “guaranteed support.” The “board of
directors” analogy above is not very accurate, and it may be more suitable to
say that these are the people who gave up their lives in favor of FreeBSD
against their better judgment!

Outside contributors

Last, but definitely not least, the largest group of developers are the users
themselves who provide feedback and bug fixes to us on an almost constant
basis. The primary way of keeping in touch with FreeBSD's more non-centralized
development is to subscribe to the FreeBSD technical discussions mailing list
where such things are discussed. See Appendix C for more information about the
various FreeBSD mailing lists.

The FreeBSD Contributors List is a long and growing one, so why not join it by
contributing something back to FreeBSD today?

Providing code is not the only way of contributing to the project; for a more
complete list of things that need doing, please refer to the FreeBSD Project
web site.

In summary, our development model is organized as a loose set of concentric
circles. The centralized model is designed for the convenience of the users of
FreeBSD, who are provided with an easy way of tracking one central code base,
not to keep potential contributors out! Our desire is to present a stable
operating system with a large set of coherent application programs that the
users can easily install and use -- this model works very well in
accomplishing that.

All we ask of those who would join us as FreeBSD developers is some of the
same dedication its current people have to its continued success!
1.3.4 The Current FreeBSD Release

FreeBSD is a freely available, full source 4.4BSD-Lite based release for Intel
i386™, i486™, Pentium®, Pentium Pro, Celeron®, Pentium II, Pentium III,
Pentium 4 (or compatible), Xeon™, DEC Alpha and Sun UltraSPARC based computer
systems. It is based primarily on software from U.C. Berkeley's CSRG group,
with some enhancements from NetBSD, OpenBSD, 386BSD, and the Free Software
Foundation.

Since our release of FreeBSD 2.0 in late 94, the performance, feature set, and
stability of FreeBSD has improved dramatically. The largest change is a
revamped virtual memory system with a merged VM/file buffer cache that not
only increases performance, but also reduces FreeBSD's memory footprint,
making a 5 MB configuration a more acceptable minimum. Other enhancements
include full NIS client and server support, transaction TCP support, dial-on-
demand PPP, integrated DHCP support, an improved SCSI subsystem, ISDN support,
support for ATM, FDDI, Fast and Gigabit Ethernet (1000 Mbit) adapters,
improved support for the latest Adaptec controllers, and many thousands of bug
fixes.

In addition to the base distributions, FreeBSD offers a ported software
collection with thousands of commonly sought-after programs. At the time of
this printing, there were over 13,300 ports! The list of ports ranges from
http (WWW) servers, to games, languages, editors, and almost everything in
between. The entire Ports Collection requires approximately 440 MB of storage,
all ports being expressed as “deltas” to their original sources. This makes it
much easier for us to update ports, and greatly reduces the disk space demands
made by the older 1.0 Ports Collection. To compile a port, you simply change
to the directory of the program you wish to install, type make install, and
let the system do the rest. The full original distribution for each port you
build is retrieved dynamically off the CDROM or a local FTP site, so you need
only enough disk space to build the ports you want. Almost every port is also
provided as a pre-compiled “package”, which can be installed with a simple
command (pkg_add) by those who do not wish to compile their own ports from
source. More information on packages and ports can be found in Chapter 4.

A number of additional documents which you may find very helpful in the
process of installing and using FreeBSD may now also be found in the /usr/
share/doc directory on any recent FreeBSD machine. You may view the locally
installed manuals with any HTML capable browser using the following URLs:

The FreeBSD Handbook

Chapter 2 Installing FreeBSD
Restructured, reorganized, and parts rewritten by Jim Mock. The sysinstall
walkthrough, screenshots, and general copy by Randy Pratt.
2.1 Synopsis

FreeBSD is provided with a text-based, easy to use installation program called
sysinstall. This is the default installation program for FreeBSD, although
vendors are free to provide their own installation suite if they wish. This
chapter describes how to use sysinstall to install FreeBSD.

After reading this chapter, you will know:

*

How to create the FreeBSD installation disks.
*

How FreeBSD refers to, and subdivides, your hard disks.
*

How to start sysinstall.
*

The questions sysinstall will ask you, what they mean, and how to answer them.

Before reading this chapter, you should:

*

Read the supported hardware list that shipped with the version of FreeBSD you
are installing, and verify that your hardware is supported.

Note: In general, these installation instructions are written for i386 (“PC
compatible”) architecture computers. Where applicable, instructions specific
to other platforms (for example, Alpha) will be listed. Although this guide is
kept as up to date as possible, you may find minor differences between the
installer and what is shown here. It is suggested that you use this chapter as
a general guide rather than a literal installation manual.

2.2 Pre-installation Tasks
2.2.1 Inventory Your Computer

Before installing FreeBSD you should attempt to inventory the components in
your computer. The FreeBSD installation routines will show you the components
(hard disks, network cards, CDROM drives, and so forth) with their model
number and manufacturer. FreeBSD will also attempt to determine the correct
configuration for these devices, which includes information about IRQ and IO
port usage. Due to the vagaries of PC hardware this process is not always
completely successful, and you may need to correct FreeBSD's determination of
your configuration.

If you already have another operating system installed, such as Windows or
Linux, it is a good idea to use the facilities provided by those operating
systems to see how your hardware is already configured. If you are not sure
what settings an expansion card is using, you may find it printed on the card
itself. Popular IRQ numbers are 3, 5, and 7, and IO port addresses are
normally written as hexadecimal numbers, such as 0x330.

We recommend you print or write down this information before installing
FreeBSD. It may help to use a table, like this:

Table 2-1. Sample Device Inventory
Device Name IRQ IO port(s) Notes
First hard disk N/A N/A 40 GB, made by Seagate, first IDE master
CDROM N/A N/A First IDE slave
Second hard disk N/A N/A 20 GB, made by IBM, second IDE master
First IDE controller 14 0x1f0
Network card N/A N/A Intel® 10/100
Modem N/A N/A 3Com® 56K faxmodem, on COM1
...
2.2.2 Backup Your Data

If the computer you will be installing FreeBSD on contains valuable data, then
ensure you have it backed up, and that you have tested the backups before
installing FreeBSD. The FreeBSD installation routine will prompt you before
writing any data to your disk, but once that process has started it cannot be
undone.
2.2.3 Decide Where to Install FreeBSD

If you want FreeBSD to use your entire hard disk, then there is nothing more
to concern yourself with at this point -- you can skip this section.

However, if you need FreeB
