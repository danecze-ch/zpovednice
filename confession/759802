I came from denmark
Hi, i heard about this site and i wanna ask you about something. I was born
and i lived 16 years in denmark. In june we moved here, because of my dads
job. I feel that nobody likes me and everybody sees the weird one, because i
dont speak czech. I am really trying and learning to but its really hard
language and people here absolutely dont wanna talk with me in english. What
am i supposed to do if i wanna find friends who dont mind that i dont speak
czech. Maybe it sounds stupid, but i believe you have some good advices.
I am absolutely lost in here

To cookie...when you will live abroad for a decades and have friends
foreigners even in my case husband then you will get what i mean.

I met younger people than ZOY ( specially from germanic countries ),with a
perfect grammar and good pronuciation,they have a good level of english in
these countries..

To be honest i think ZOY is a czech kid who is practising english in czech
portal.The way that text was written reminded me of czechoslovakian style.

Maybe i am wrong but this is based on my experience of living abroad for a
very long time .

I dont care if you or any other spoilt brat gonna judge my english ,thats i
leave for my uni proffesor. Not you :) i just can laugh about it

Hey Zoy! How did you learn about this site? Which part of the country are you
in now?

To Hmm: Her grammar is great for a 17-year-old. Your grammar is not perfect
either.

hi, i am sure there are more people at your age at similar situation. Try to
find some of them ...
Czech lang. isn´t so hard ... when you want just talk ... for some girls it
can be funny (at good meaning), so just try it ....

I hope you dont get offended , if i say ,that considering the fact that you
come from denmark your english grammar is not as good as other people from
germanic countries.If i am wrong and you really are from denmark ,please
accept my apology.
I just say this simply cos i have encountered a few people from denmark and
their english was almost like perfect.

I think that some czech kid is taking mick out of the people here

but if its genuine...good luck and try to ignore all the negativisum

I think many people would like to pracice english speaking, if they left
school (like me)...and if you're girl do not worry about friends here. Just
hang in there and you will see it should be better... keep fingers crossed.

Well it´s probably because Czech people and Danish people are natural mortal
enemies, just like the Czech people and the Bulgarians or Czech people and the
Mongols.

If you dont speak Czech, you're always gonna be the "weirdo" for most people
here. But I have a great news for you, the Czech language is one of the
hardest even for us, Czech people! :D
Many people are pricks because they cant understand you, cant speak english at
good level and are maybe also ashamed of this. They are also suspicious when
they see the stranger.
You can try to join some international english-speaking school I guess, there
you shouldnt have so big problems and you could also learn Czech there. But
its gonna be a long run.
At the end I think that most people in general sucks here. I love czechs
nature and food and almost everything, except the people here.
If u wanna something know u can write me in profile or mail ;)

Enjoy the fight! I woulnt like to be in your shoes.
